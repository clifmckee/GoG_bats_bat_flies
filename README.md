Files from [McKee et al. (2024) Parasitology](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0031182024000660) - "Ectoparasite and bacterial population genetics and community structure indicate extent of bat movement across an island chain". Includes data and code for the analysis of *Bartonella* prevalence and diversity in bat flies sampled from Gulf of Guinea islands, West Africa.

Shape files for bat geographic ranges (and all other terrestrial mammals) are available from [IUCN](https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/spatial-data-download).

One large (300 MB) data file 'mammterr.RData' is available by request ([clifton.mckee@gmail.com](mailto:clifton.mckee@gmail.com)).
